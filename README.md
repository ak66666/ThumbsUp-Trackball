# ThumbsUp! Trackball

A PCB-based thumb-operated trackball, inspired by Elecom EX-G left hand trackball and my own ThumbsUp! keyboards.

Device is envsioned as suitable for both left- and right-hand usage.
For that one of the plates could be re-attached at 180 degree and the cross-board connectors will swap left and right buttons.
 
Off-the-shelf MCU is considered: ProMicro-style Atmega- or RP2040-based.
QMK-based firmware.

34 mm ball, same as in Elecom EX-G.
For bearings - uxcell 2.5mm Ceramic Bearing Balls, ZrO2 Zirconium Oxide Ball, again, the same as used to improve my Elecom trackballs.
